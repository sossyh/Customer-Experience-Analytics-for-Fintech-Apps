# 📊 Customer Experience Analytics for Fintech Apps

This project analyzes user reviews from mobile banking applications to better understand customer experiences, identify satisfaction drivers, and uncover pain points. Using natural language processing (NLP), particularly transformer-based sentiment analysis, we quantify customer sentiment and generate insights that can help improve app performance and user satisfaction.
